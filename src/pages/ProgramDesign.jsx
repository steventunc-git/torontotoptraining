        Have you been doing online workout programs? Have you reached a point of stagnation?
        (Commonly known as a "plateau"). Reaching a specific target goal will require a bespoke
        training program as you reach the ceiling of your potential.
      </p>

      <p>
        The truth is that almost all training programs in big-box gyms follow the "periodization"
        method stemming from Soviet bloc training. In simplified form, this is the basis behind what
        is known as "progressive overload". This is effectively a way to plan and program your body
        to reach certain milestones such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Building Lean Mass</li>
        <li>Achieving PRs (Personal Records) for major movement patterns</li>
        <li>Burning a specific amount of non-lean mass</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Seen below in simplified form, this method of planning can take place as far ahead as a year
        and will plan for specific dates of milestone achievement whether in athletic competition or
        social engagements like weddings or reunions. This methodology is the most efficient way to
        plan your progression over the Short, Medium, and Long-Term (known as a Micro, Meso, and
        Macro-Cycle respectively).
      </p>

      <p>
        Periodization is the most specific way to tailor your workout around your biology. It can be
        combined with meal planning, hormone optimization, or accommodations for conditions like
        diabetes. Specialized programs are necessary for all intermediate to professional-level
        fitness enthusiasts.
      </p>

      <p>
        In summary, whether creating a short-term plan or a long-term periodized cycle, a tailored
        workout program is the most efficient way to reach your goals.
