        Have you been following online programs and hit a plateau? Reaching a specific goal
        often requires a customized approach tailored to your individual needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most commercial programs rely on simplified versions of “periodization” — a method
        originally developed in Soviet-era training. Properly applied, it’s the gold standard
        for long-term progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Periodization helps you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Build lean muscle efficiently</li>
        <li>Break through stagnation</li>
        <li>Hit personal records with precision</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Whether you're prepping for a competition, recovering from injury, or simply want a
        roadmap that works — a customized program will take your training to the next level.
